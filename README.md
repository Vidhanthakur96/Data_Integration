# Data_Integration
With this task an attempt was made to integrate data from two different sources (csv files) using Python3. Source files have few columns in common and they have collectively 1.8M rows so merging them manually is not possible as tools like MS Excel have limitations. After merging files uncommon rows had a NaN values which was replaced by 0 and saved to CSV output file.
